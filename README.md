# HellCore
Source code for the HellCore project, a fork of LambdaMOO.

## Known dependencies:
* libstdc++
* gperf

## README

This is an attempt at making a hellcore MOO database. Started from HellMOO, I
deleted tons of Hell-specific objects and verbs. I might have deleted useful
stuff, I more than likely left references to useless/deleted props/objects all
over the place.

To start it, you will need to run something like this:

> ./moo -l moo.log hellcore.db hell.db.test 7777 > (./moo -l <logfile> <original DB> <new DB> <port>)

or just:

> ./restart hellcore

You should be able to login with 'connect Wizard', then change your password.

### Building

FOR UNICODE BRANCH ONLY:

Change to the src directory, and run this commands:

> gperf -aCIptT -k1,3,$ keywords.gperf | sed -e 's/#include <ctype.h>/#include "my-ctype.h"/' > keywords.c

> bison -dy parser.y

In any branch:

> make

This should build the moo binary.

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I DENY RESPONSIBILITY FOR:
* Spontaneous hairy nose
* Micropenis
* Liver vs pancreas internal war
* Making baby Jesus retch
* Getting on the No-Fly list
* Lizard people living under the Appalachian Mountains following you around

Cheers,

Senso/Dionysus, Necanthrope
