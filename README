This is an attempt at making a hellcore MOO database. Started from HellMOO, I
deleted tons of Hell-specific objects and verbs. I might have deleted useful
stuff, I more than likely left references to useless/deleted props/objects all
over the place.

To start it, you will need to run something like this:
./moo -l moo.log hellcore.db hell.db.test 7777
(./moo -l <logfile> <original DB> <new DB> <port>)

or just:

./restart hellcore

You should be able to login with 'connect Wizard', then change your password.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I DENY RESPONSIBILITY FOR:
- Spontaneous hairy nose
- Micropenis
- Liver vs pancreas internal war
- Making baby Jesus retch
- Getting on the No-Fly list
- Lizard people living under the Appalachian Mountains following you around

Cheers,

Senso/Dionysus
